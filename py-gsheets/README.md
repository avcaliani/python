This is an example of reading Google Sheets data.

## Quick Start

Installing project dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv .venv \
  && source .venv/bin/activate \
  && python -m pip install --upgrade pip \
  && poetry install
```

### Configuring Google Cloud

I know that there are other ways to authenticate and retrieve the same results, but here I'm going to show how it worked
for me.

This step-by-step guide was updated on 20/11/2021.

First, go to [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started). Then, create your project.

When you go to APIs & Services click on "Enable API", then at search field look after "sheets" and enable Google Sheets
API.

Now, it's time to create your credentials.

After creating the service account, you will realize that it looks like an e-mail, save it because we are going to use
this "email address" later.<br>
Now, click on it, you will be redirected to Google IAM page.

After that, a JSON file should be downloaded with your credentials. Then, you have to move the JSON file to project root
and rename it to `credentials.json`.

Finally, at Google Sheets, share you sheets with you Service Account "email".
